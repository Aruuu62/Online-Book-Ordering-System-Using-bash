The "Online Book Ordering System" is a command-line application developed as a project for an operating system laboratory. The primary goal is to demonstrate the integration of basic operating system commands and scripting using Bash in Linux. This system allows users to interact with a virtual bookstore, browse books, place orders, and view order history.

System Features
The application supports the following features:

1. View Available Books
Displays a list of books with their respective prices.
2. Place an Order
Allows users to select books from the available list and add them to their order.
3. View Order History
Shows a summary of previously placed orders, including total cost.
4. Exit the System
Gracefully exits the application.

Technical Details
Programming Language: Bash Script
Operating System: Linux (Tested on Ubuntu)
Tools Used: Terminal, Nano/Vim text editor

This project demonstrates the practical application of Bash scripting in developing a simple yet functional command-line application. It is an excellent example of how basic operating system features can be used to create interactive systems. Future improvements can make the system more robust and feature-rich.
